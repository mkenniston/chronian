TODO:

- document why I do *not* follow language-specific styles: these
	files are designed to be consistent across languages, not across
	programmers, because they all get maintained at once.

- fix regex in "C"

- add parsing S-exprs
- add executing S-exprs
- add testing framework
- add self-test
- add skeleton RuleSet classes
- add ability to call native objects

- add real chronian classes and methods, w/ tests
