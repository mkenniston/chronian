TODO:

Sub-project:  "Short IDs"
    - write intro for group, explain purpose and context, emphasize version
        zero, if consensus then we will propose back to main tz list
    - topic:  primary/secondary, the idea, diff from tzdata "link",
        specific examples
    - topic:  csv versus tab-separated table
    - topic:  three choices (a) all region code, (b) all airport code,
        (c) hybrid
    - topic: reserve for TAI, UT, TT, etc. ?  if so, include in table? which?
    - topic: could make even shorter w/ arbitrary 2-letter codes, but then why
        not just number them (fits in 9-10 bits)?  maybe do both?
    - topic: could add comments for each entry about why that code was chosen,
        would that be useful or just hundreds of lines of clutter?

    - look at all tzdata files, see what's in there
    - read last year of tzdata mailing list, get a feel
    - post a note:
        As part of a larger project, I needed a table of short IDs
    (1-4 characters) for all the IANA-defined time zones,
    and it turns out that you can avoid most of the "tower of Babel effect"
    by re-using existing international codes (from ISO, IATA, and ICAO) for
    the vast majority of the names.  The actual process of building
    such a table (470-ish entries) was about as tedious
    and time-consuming as you'd expect it to be, so I'd be
    happy to share/open-source/contribute this for others to
    use.  If this is on-topic for this list I can provide more details here;
    otherwise if you're interested feel free to email me ("mike@chronian.com")
    off-list.

Sub-project:  cross-platform testing



- learn enough Scheme to implement the needed subset, especially
lexical scoping, macros, proper terminology, and exception handling

- look at ant, set up build files w/ make clean, make test,
	make distribution zips files, etc.

- add a symbol table, which "interns" symbols so the are (eq?) and
	the name is only stored once.  A given symbol may appear more
	than once in the environment stack.
	Don't bother interning literal strings.

- add [] list syntax
- add (a.b) dotted syntax

- change Lexeme to SExpr, add types List, Atom, Number, and print method,
    and add read_sexpr()
	- python
	- java
	- javascript
	- C

- add executing S-exprs

change names Integer -> LispInteger, SExpr -> LispExpr, etc.

- class hierarchy:
Value -> SExpr | Callable
Callable -> Procedure | Transformer
Procedure -> Lambda | BuiltIn
Transformer -> DefinedForm | CoreForm | QuoteForm

- add SymbolTable, Environment, lexical scoping, integrate w/ eval()
- add simple try/throw/catch as CoreForms
- move lexical scanner to lisp, use scheme to translate into direct
	memory initialization in each target language

- get all var names and modules consistent across langs

- add testing framework
- add self-test

- add skeleton RuleSet classes
- add ability to call native objects
- add real chronian classes and methods, w/ tests (use TDD)
- make a distribution directory, w/ one zip file per supported language,
	which contains source (library only, not tests), an example
	program (that works!), and the API spec for that language

- add all the airport codes

- write the Appendix that lists and reviews most (?) existing
datetime libraries
	- extract the ideas that I want to copy (giving credit where due)
	- identify what's unique about Chronian (e.g. multi-language support)

- write the Appendix that lists good resources, including:
	https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html  # detailed info
	https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/  # archived releases

- find where the datetime people hang out on reddit, quora, stackoverflow,
or wherever.
	- Get involved in the discussions.
	- Collect interesting problems that people need to solve.
	- Identify shortcomings in existing libraries.

Next batches of languages to support:
- PHP, C#, C++, Ruby
- Swift, Objective C, Go

Other Languages to consider adding support for:
- ELixir
- Clojure
- Rust
- Scheme
- Perl
- Delphi/Object Pascal
- Erlang
- OCaml
- Haskell
- R
- Matlab
- F#
- Groovy

"Free" languages:
- TypeScript and CoffeeScript (interop with JavaScript)
- Visual Basic .NET (interop with C#.NET)
- Kotlin and Scala (interop with Java)
- Bash (just script it with Python or Ruby)

Other:
- SQL (not really a programming language, but Chronian needs to
pay attention to interoperability with SQL data types)
- HTML and CSS (do not count as programming languages in this context)
- Assembly (interop with the C version)

Add to docs:

Using Scheme as the test framework is very much in the same spirit as
the Guile project in GNU.  The big differences are that Chronian implements
a minimial subset of Scheme instead of the whole language, and it is not
limited to integrating with C and C++.

Add to docs:

We don't need to provide a full manual for the testing language, because
there are already lots of good tutorials and books about Scheme.  Read
the first couple chapters of any of them and you'll be ready to write
Chronian tests.  We do provide a list of what features and built-ins are
and are not included in the testing framework:

Add to docs:

An Appendix describing the algorithm for choosing aiport codes as
short-names for zones.

Add to docs:

Java programmers will be familiar with the goal of "write once, run
anywhere".  By providing a uniform API, Chronian applies this idea
in a different context so that you can "learn once, write anywhere".
